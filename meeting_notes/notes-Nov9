Permissions:
        * User has file that has list of permissions
          * Configure to add more perms at runtime
          * app would say "I need this permission"
           * user interacts and says yes once, yes always
          


       * Generic permission file
         * each app has different permissons
           *trust app gives what ever app

       * just downloaded app 
        * want no permissions



Ideas for ls:
      read or openj file function call -- in our language
       * hnder the hood does perm check
        *look at perm file (do i have permission to list files in this dir)
         * if yes 
          *run racket opemn
         if no  
          return excetpion



Things to do:
* wrap the rackets IO functions
  * read permission file
  * throw errors
  * call normal function return data




s-exp permissions:
      * list of permissions
        * s-exp permission name and arguments

        (include "/home/scotty/generic-perms")

        (fs-read "/foo/bar")
        (fs-write "/home/name")

      * truested environment vars

      * Read everything in home dir _except_
         *list of secure dirs that need explicit perms to read/write

      * cat and ls
