\section{Introduction}\label{section:Introduction}
Many permission models today are broken for the type of applications being used today. We've gone from multi-tennant systems where you wanted to protect your files from the other users to sing-tennant systems where you want to protect your files from your apps. The permission models have not kept pace with the change in computing landscape. We present a new permission model based on the idea that you have data to protect, and you want to protect it against snooping applications. We design and implement our language inside of Racket\cite{racket}. We evaluate our base implementation by building up two common command line programs, ls and cat. Using these programs we evaluate our permission model to prevent access to certain resources.
